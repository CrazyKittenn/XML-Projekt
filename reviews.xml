        <Image>Images/Batman_Arkham_Knight.png</Image>
        <Description>Batman confronts the ultimate threat against the city he has been sworn to
            protect. The Scarecrow returns to congeal an imposing array of super villains, including
            The Penguin, Two-Face and Harley Quinn, to summarily destroy The Dark Knight. The game
            introduces Rocksteady's uniquely-designed imagining of the Batmobile drivable for the
            first time in the franchise. Batman: Arkham Knight offers gamers a complete Batman
            experience as they rip through the streets and soar across the skyline of the iconic
            Gotham City.</Description>

        <Description>1946: Europe. World War II rages on across Europe. Where the Allies once

            Captain B.J. Blazkowicz, the American War Hero. After delving into this world of
            darkness, you must launch an impossible counter-offensive against the monstrous Nazi
            regime. Only you dare stand up against an unstoppable army of Nazi robots and hulking
            Super Soldiers. Only you can stop Deathshead. Only you can rewrite history.</Description>

        <Title>Cuphead</Title>
        <Image>Images/Cuphead.png</Image>
        <Description>Cuphead is a classic run and gun action game primarily focused on boss battles.
            Inspired by the cartoons of the 1930s, the visuals and audio are carefully created with
            the same techniques of the era, i.e. traditional cel animation (hand drawn &amp; hand
            inked), watercolor backgrounds, and original jazz recordings. Play as Cuphead or Mugman
            (in single player or co-op) as you traverse strange worlds, acquire new weapons, learn
            powerful super moves, and discover hidden secrets.</Description>
